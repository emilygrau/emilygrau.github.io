                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I am Emily Grau, a third-year student at Georgia Tech, pursuing a B.S. of Computer Engineering. I was not lucky enough to attend a high school that taught computer science and I begun my academic career at Georgia Tech as a future civil engineer. During my first semester, I enrolled in the class, Computing for Engineers, and I found something in coding and technology that I was truly passionate about. By the end of the semester I officially switched my major to computer engineering and never looked back.  You, like many others, may ask why CmpE and not CS? To that I say, knowing how any device works at its core has always intereseted me.  Most people float through life accepting that the inner workings of technology are a web of intangible enigmas.  I am not willing to accept things just as they are, but would rather understand them so that I can improve them.  In an age where the future is technology, I think it's important to understand how the devices that are changing the world truly work, so that I can be part of the change.  
                  </p>
                    
                <p>Now, as a future computer engineer, I am adept in both high-level and low-level languages. In the hardware realm, I have experience with circuitry and embedded devices. Everyday I am coding and doing my best to advance in the languages I already know and love, as well as learning new languages to add to my repertoire.  Whether it be through school or on my own, I am always looking for experiences that will allow me to grow as a computer engineer. </p>

                <h3>Crestron Electronics, Inc.</h3>
                <h6> May 2017 - August 2017 </h6>
                <p>Crestron is known for their award-winning automation and control solutions for buildings and homes that allow people to control entire environments with the push of a button. I worked at Crestron as an intern in the Test Engineering department. I was given a project that seemed entirely outside the scope of my abilities at the time.  Using a BeagleBone microcontroller and an FPGA embedded graphics display, I was tasked with creating a universal switching remote connected to a GUI application that prompted the selected relays. I rose to the occasion, impressing myself and my peers as I perserved and accomplished my goals throughout the internship.     </p>
