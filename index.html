                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hey there! I'm Emily, a third-year student at Georgia Tech pursuing a BS of Computer Engineering. I had gone into my first year of college as a future Civil Engineer, but shorly after taking "Computing for Engineers" where I learned MATLAB, I fell in love with coding. At the end of the semester I officially made the switch to Computer Engineering (despite the echoing fears of my friends).  You, like many others, may ask why CmpE and not CS? To that I say hardware has always intereseted me. Especially in an age where the future is technology, learning how it all works opens so many more opportunities for me.  
                  </p>
                    
                <p>Along with trying to become <a href="https://jessicaslaughter.github.io/pinterest-progress" target="_blank">Pinterest famous</a>, one of my favorite things to do is help people through my blog-turned-job! I'm currently helping young women be successful in college and start blogs of their own at <a href="http://jessicaslaughter.co" target="_blank">JessicaSlaughter.co</a>, a blog I've poured my heart into since the beginning of 2016 and use as a platform to further my skills and creativity.</p>

                <p>A merge of an old blog and new interests, I started <a href="http://jessicaslaughter.co" target="_blank">this blog</a> in January 2016 as a more casual environment to share college and lifestyle tips, while continuing to help others start their own blogs! I've since garnered an audience of young women around the world providing over 200,000 monthly views, and joined networks including <a href="http://collectivelyinc.com/" target="_blank">Collectively</a>, the <a href="http://www.hercampusmedia.com/services/influenceher-collective" target="_blank">InfluenceHer Collective</a>, and <a href="http://whoispollinate.com/" target="_blank">Pollinate Media</a>. I've also had the opportunity to collaborate with brands like Lenovo, Office Depot, and PayPal to create content that generates engagement and awareness for both my blog and their products.</p>

                <h3>3 Day Startup Austin - Co-Lead Organizer</h3>
                <h6>2014 - present</h6>
                <p>3 Day Startup is a 72-hour learning-by-doing workshop that teaches entrepreneurial skills to university students in an extreme hands-on environment. After participating in <a href="http://austin.3daystartup.org/" target="_blank">3 Day Startup Austin</a> as a freshman, I joined this organization under their tech recruitment team. I'm currently a co-lead organizer of the event and responsible for managing the recruitment team, running an intense crash course, interviewing potential participants, and promoting the event throughout the semester.</p>
